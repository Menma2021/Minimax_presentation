# Minimax Visualizer based on Tic-Tac-Toe (for MIMUC presentation)

## Overview
This project implements a visualizer for the Tic-Tac-Toe Minimax algorithm with optional alpha-beta pruning, used in my presentation for MIMUC. It allows users to visualize the decision tree generated by the algorithm, including board states and minimax evaluations

## Features
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Minimax algorithm with optional alpha-beta pruning for optimization
- **Custom Board Sizes**: Supports different board sizes (mxn) and winning conditions (k-in-a-row) (m,n,k-games)
- **Move Prioritization**: Option to prioritize moves that lead to winning states faster
- **Decision Tree Visualization**:
  - Standard tree visualization with node values;
  - Board visualization at each decision node;
  - Highlighting of optimal move chain
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optimization algorithm to reduce search space
- **Graph-based Representation**: Uses NetworkX and GraphViz for generating decision tree graphs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy networkx matplotlib pillow pygraphviz
  ```
  **Note:** GraphViz must be installed separately. Refer to [GraphViz Installation Guide](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/). Setting it up on Windows can be not straightforward

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Menma2021/Minimax_presentation.git
   cd Minimax_presentation
   ```
2. Ensure that all dependencies are installed

## Usage
### Running the Visualizer
```python
from tictactoe_visualizer import TicTacToeVisualizer

visualizer = TicTacToeVisualizer(m=3, n=3, k=3, depth=3, pruning=True, predefined_board=[
    ["X", "O", "X"],
    ["O", ".", "X"],
    [".", "O", "."]
])

visualizer.build_tree(True)  # Can change maximizing to false for first move by minimizer

# Basic decision tree
visualizer.visualize_tree()

# Board decision tree visualization with values
visualizer.visualize_boards_with_values()
```

### Customizing the Game
- Change `m`, `n`, and `k` to modify the board size and winning conditions
- Adjust `depth` to control the tree depth (AKA how much moves ahead the algorithm looks at)
- Enable or disable alpha-beta pruning using `pruning=True/False`
- Provide a custom starting board using `predefined_board`
- Inside `visualize_boards_with_values`, there are an option to change visualizations to whatever you prefer

## Notes
- Large board sizes or depths beyond 4 can make visualization difficult and long
- Board images will be saved in `board_images` folder
- Graphs will be saved directly in the repository folder
- There are some additional folders with some images from the presentation (or at least with images that where planned to be used in there)
